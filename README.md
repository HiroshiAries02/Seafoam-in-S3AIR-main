# Seafoam-in-S3AIR-main

A genderless squid was chillin in their night clothes, playing Sonic 3 & Knuckles on a human artifact called a "SEGA Mega Drive". They pass out, obviously (it's 1 in the morning), and wake up on Angel Island! Turns out something pulled them in to be the hero, with Knuckles captured and Tails fearful of the new threat, and Sonic's busy with Eggman on his island!

Set before the events of Extra Slot Mighty & Ray, during SegaSonic the Hedgehog, and after Knuckles' Story...
Extra Slot Seafoam for Fadeinside's Extra Slot Characters v8, or ESC Unlimited!

Run, Slide, and use their athletic body to make it through!
