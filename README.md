# Seafoam-in-S3AIR-main

A genderless squid was chillin in their night clothes, playing Sonic 3 & Knuckles on a human artifact called a "SEGA Mega Drive". They pass out, obviously (it's 1 in the morning), and wake up on Angel Island! Turns out something pulled them in to be the hero, with Knuckles fearful of a new threat, and mistakes Seafoam for an intruder! Seafoam must make it through Angel Island, and its harsh climates to (hopefully) find a way home!

Set after the events of Sonic's story, and before Knux's...
Extra Slot Seafoam for Fadeinside's Extra Slot Characters v8, or ESC Unlimited!

Run, Slide, Climb, and Dash to make it through!
