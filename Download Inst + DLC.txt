As Seafoam will be releasing on ECSU, Seafoam gets DLC for their campaign, acheivements, etc.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD SEAFOAM WHEN THEY RELEASE:
MAIN MOD:
  1. Go to the CODE button, and click it.
  2. Press "Download as ZIP"
  3. When downloaded, place the ZIP folder in your S3AIR mods folder. DO NOT EXTRACT. (S3AIR can indeed read ZIP files)
  4. Turn off all mods except ECSU. You can then toy around with what mods work or not.

UPDATING THE MOD:
  STYLE 1:
    1. Repeat the MAIN MOD download instructions (1 - 2).
    2. Go to S3AIR's mod folder and delete the previous version.
    3. Place new version of mod in the folder.
  
  STYLE 2:
    1. Go to Releases, and download the latest update.
    2. Grab your previous version, and unzip the file.
    3. Copy the files from the latest release and replace any old ones.
 
 DLC CONTENT:
  1. Go to Releases and pick anything that has "DLC" in it.
  2. Unzip the file, and place the mod folder in your S3AIR mods folder.
  3. In S3AIR, place any DLC above Seafoam, and have the base mod for that DLC active.
    (EX: Seafoam's Campaign requires ECSU and Seafoam to be enabled.)
